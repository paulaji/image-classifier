install these packages: pip3 install numpy matplotlib tensorflow pillow streamlit

first, run the model.py file
after 10 epochs (or specified number), the model will be created with the name specified in model.save() | give an h5 extension to the model name

accuracy obtained while training: close to 0.5
note: try increasing epochs count | the accuracy although not exponentially growing, saw good increases in the first few training sessions and slight increases in the last couple

after that, create a main.py file to setup the streamlit part
to run streamlit on the browser: streamlit run main.py
